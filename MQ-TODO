TODO list for multiqueue/new-queue. In no particular order.
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Better switching scheme for deciding when to run
  queues inline and when to punt to kblockd.

- Implement proper scheme for not having lots of processes
  or kblockds hammering on blk_mq_run_hw_queue() at the same
  time. If someone else is already running the queue, we need
  not do anything. (partially done)

- Barrier support

- Improve the tagging to make it more per-cpu friendly. Things really fall
  apart if we exhaust our tag map and have to wait. Cache the tags or
  requests on a per ctx basis, ensuring that it's also fair between ctx's.

- Add token based mq aware IO scheduler
