	  Btrfs core is the core tree implementation of btrfs.

	  Btrfs core is highly experimental. It require special hardware that 
	  allows btrfs to pass tree operations toward the block interface.
	  Furthermore, THE DISK FORMAT IS NOT YET FINALIZED.  You should 
	  say N here unless you are interested in testing Btrfs with 
	  non-critical data.

	  To compile this part of btrfssupport as a module, choose M here. The
	  module will be called btrfscore.

	  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  Enable run-time debugging support for the btrfs filesystem. This may
	  enable additional and expensive checks with negative impact on
	  performance, or export extra information via sysfs.

	  If unsure, say N.
